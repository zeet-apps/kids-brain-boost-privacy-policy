  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 30, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and protection of your information when you use the Kids Brain Boost app.</p>

  <p>We collect minimal personal data and store it <strong>locally on your device</strong>. By using the app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The app may ask for your first and last name to personalize the learning experience. This information is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Entered manually by the user</li>
    <li>Stored only on the device</li>
    <li>Never transmitted or shared externally</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Use of Data</h2>
  <p>We use the entered name only to personalize the experience (e.g., displaying the user's name during quizzes). No analytics, advertising, or external services collect or access this data.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is designed for children ages <strong>5 and up</strong>. We do not knowingly collect any sensitive personal data or data that requires parental consent under laws like COPPA.</p>
  <p>The only information requested is the child’s first and last name, which stays on the device and is not shared or stored externally. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has submitted personal data inappropriately, please contact us and we will remove it.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Transfers</h2>
  <p><strong>No personal information</strong> is shared with third parties or transferred to external servers. All user data remains on the device.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the limited data we collect. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. As we store data only on-device, no data is accessible remotely.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>The app does not contain external links to third-party websites or services.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. If we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date above.</p>
