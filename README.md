# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** March 30, 2025

We collect minimal personal data and store it **locally on your device**. By using the app, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## Information We Collect

The app may ask for your **first and last name** to personalize the learning experience. This information is:

- Entered manually by the user  
- Stored only on the device  
- Never transmitted or shared externally

## Use of Data

We use the entered name only to personalize the experience (e.g., displaying the user's name during quizzes).  
**No analytics, advertising, or external services** collect or access this data.

## Children's Privacy

Our app is designed for children ages **5 and up**. We do not knowingly collect any sensitive personal data or data that requires parental consent under laws like **COPPA**.

The only information requested is the childâ€™s name, which stays on the device and is not shared externally.  
If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has submitted personal data inappropriately, please contact us and we will remove it.

## Data Sharing and Transfers

We do **not share** or transmit any personal information outside of the app.  
All data remains securely stored on the user's device.

## Security

We take reasonable steps to protect the limited data we collect.  
However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.  
Since all data is stored locally, **no user data is accessible remotely**.

## Third-Party Links

The app does **not contain** links to external websites or services.
